# AI Agent Prompt: Execute Selected Implementation Tasks

## Objective

Execute specific tasks from an implementation plan with precision and verify their completion according to specifications.

## Input Requirements

The input must include:
- A comprehensive implementation plan in Markdown format
- Explicit selection of tasks to be executed in this session
- Design specifications related to the selected tasks (if applicable)

## Task Selection Format

Tasks for execution must be specified using this format:
```
Execute tasks: [List of task numbers or identifiers, e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.3]
```

## Output Requirements

The output must include:
- Implementation of all selected tasks
- Verification that specifications for selected tasks have been met
- Appropriate verification checklist based on the nature of the tasks

## Review Requirements

Before implementation, the selected tasks must be reviewed for:
- Clear understanding of task scope and dependencies
- Availability of all necessary information
- Alignment with project guidelines and technical stack
- Completeness of relevant specifications

If any selected task is unclear or missing information, clarification must be requested before proceeding.

## Task Types and Implementation Guidelines

### UI/Design Tasks

UI implementation must:
- Follow the comprehensive staged implementation approach:
  1. **Basic Structure & Types Implementation**
     - Review the design JSON file thoroughly before starting implementation
     - Create all required TypeScript interfaces and types
     - Set up basic component structure and hierarchy with proper semantic HTML
     - Define loading and error state handling
     - Create component skeleton with appropriate HTML elements
     
  2. **Color & Typography Implementation**
     - Check `tailwind.config.ts` for existing color tokens matching design
     - Add any missing color tokens to `tailwind.config.ts` with proper naming
     - Use semantic color tokens over direct hex values whenever possible
     - Match font sizes, weights, line heights, and letter spacing precisely
     - Implement text content exactly as shown in design (check singular/plural, capitalization)
     
  3. **Layout & Spacing Implementation**
     - Match component dimensions, padding, margin, and gap values precisely
     - Use Tailwind spacing units that correspond to design dimensions
     - Implement exact column structure and order from design
     - Ensure element ordering and sequence numbers match design specification
     - Pay special attention to alignment of text and other elements
     
  4. **Interaction & Refinement Implementation**
     - Add hover, focus, and active states for interactive elements
     - Implement conditional styling (e.g., positive/negative values)
     - Add animation and transition effects where specified
     - Ensure responsive behavior works according to design specifications
     - Validate accessibility with proper ARIA attributes where needed

- Compare final implementation against design JSON and visual documentation
- Verify exact text content matches (check for singular vs. plural forms, capitalization)
- Include comprehensive verification tables for all design elements

### Integration/Functionality Tasks

Functionality implementation must:
- Establish correct data flow between components
- Implement proper state management
- Configure API services and connections
- Handle loading, error, and edge cases
- Include appropriate validation and error handling

### Backend/API Tasks

Backend implementation must:
- Follow RESTful API principles
- Include proper validation and error handling
- Implement database operations correctly
- Address security considerations
- Include appropriate unit tests

## Task Dependency Management

If a selected task depends on unimplemented prerequisites:
- Identify and document the dependencies
- Suggest an optimal order of implementation
- Proceed with independent tasks first if possible

## Implementation Standards

The implementation must:
- Adhere strictly to file paths, code structures, and configurations specified in the plan
- Follow project coding standards and best practices
- Create implementations that match specifications for the selected tasks
- Include appropriate comments and documentation
- Respect the established architecture and patterns
